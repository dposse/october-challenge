The next step is a small coding exercise the instructions are below:

Facebook has a concept called an Adset. It is a data structure used to store information about who and where an Ad in Facebook will be served. Many of our clients will frequently use similar geo locations to target a specific group of people. To aid them from entering similar data multiple times, create a solution that will return the top 5 most frequent geo locations. 

Use the following url to retrieve the list of Facebook Adset objects: 

https://app.wordstream.com/services/v1/wordstream/interview_data

Each Adset will have a property of targeting. This property is used to determine who the Adset is served to. Within the targeting there is another property of geo_locations. These locations span the following subtypes: zips, regions, cities, countries, and geo_markets. Write a solution that will find the top 5 most frequent geo locations in the data set and return them as a list of objects. The most frequent geo locations can come from a mix of these subtypes. 

Back end requirements:
Write an endpoint that will return the most frequent geolocations 

Front end requirements:
Responsive
Create a component that displays the top geo locations 
Allow for them to be removed individually
Uses css or scss for styling
Feel free to do the backend version or frontend version which ever you are more comfortable with.   You can use any language/tools for the code.    You can also have as much fun as you like with it, really whatever time you want to put into it.
